# We are going to simulate data for a 3 way mixed anova: between/within/within
# Our dependent variable is Score. 
# We have two equal groups (0 and 1), as between subjects variables
# Each subject is measured on two occasions (1 and 2), on easy and hard task (1 and 2)
# This gives 4 scores (easytime1, hardtime1, easytime2, hardtime2) for each subject
# We are just going to generate random numbers - there is no real effect
# We will look for effects of factors group, occasion, and difficulty, 
# as well as interactions between these

# Be warned: as this website notes: http://www.statmethods.net/stats/anova.html
# 'If you have been analyzing ANOVA designs in traditional statistical packages, 
#  you are likely to find R's approach less coherent and user-friendly'
# Our aim here, though, is not to teach you to do ANOVA in R, so much as to 
# reveal some of the pitfalls in interpreting multiway ANOVA

    mydata$Group <-as.factor(mydata$Group)  #this is important!
    # You can look at mydata by clicking on its label in the Environment tab
    #----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Save your simulated data as tab-separated text
    #----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    write.table(mydata, "/users/mje/anova_sim/repro17/mixed_model_eeg_simulation/data/simulated_data.txt", sep=",") 
    # You could use saved data if you want to double-check against output of Anova from another package
    # But see comments in script 2: advisable to comment out this line once you've got the idea
    # And note that on each run, the file will be overwritten with latest output
    # (Easy to fix by changing the file name on each run, but you don't want your computer
    # clogged up with loads of unwanted files - though you might like to see if you could
    # work out how to achieve this, just as an exercise)
    #----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # There are various ways of doing ANOVA in R: most require data to be in long form
    #  For explanation see http://seananderson.ca/2013/10/19/reshape.html
    #----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    mylongdata <- melt(mydata) #converts to long form, with one column with all scores
    mylongdata$Subject <- c(seq(1:(myN*2)),seq(1:(myN*2)),seq(1:(myN*2)),seq(1:(myN*2)))
    # Add a column giving subject ID: this is repeated for each combination of conditions
    
    mylongdata$time <-c(rep(1,myN*2*2),rep(2,myN*2*2)) #adds column giving time
    mylongdata$difficulty <-c(rep(1,myN*2),rep(2,myN*2),rep(1,myN*2),rep(2,myN*2))#adds column giving difficulty
    # Note that there are more general ways of reshaping data: this is just simple for this design
    # Look now at longdata by clicking on its name in the Environment tab
    
    #----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Now run an ANOVA
    #----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    myaov<-summary(aov(value~(time*difficulty*Group)+Error(Subject/(time*difficulty)),data=mylongdata))
    myaovbit<-unlist(myaov$`Error: Within`) # tortuous way to extract the relevant bit of output
    ptable[i,1:7] <-myaovbit[33:39] #extract the p-values which happen to be values 33-39 in this output
    ptable[i,8:9]<-0 #initialise col 8-9 which will categorise each ANOVA in terms of whether *any* sig effects
    sigp<-which(ptable[i,1:7]<.05) #find whether any p-values are < .05
    if(length(sigp)>0)
    {ptable[i,8]<-1} # if so, assign a 1 to column 8
    sigp<-which(ptable[i,1:7]<.007) #now do the same with p < .007, i.e. .05/7
    if(length(sigp)>0)
    {ptable[i,9]<-1} #result is stored in column 9
    
# The way ptable is populated is a pretty clunky way of doing things, 
#  but I hope it is reasonably easy to follow
# This is a much more elegant alternative for lines 83-90
# suggested by my colleague Paul Thompson:
# ptable[i,1:7]<-myaov[["Error: Within"]][[1]]$'Pr(>F)'[1:7]
# ptable[i,8]<-ifelse(any(ptable[i,1:7]<.05)==TRUE,1,0)
# ptable[i,9]<-ifelse(any(ptable[i,1:7]<.007)==TRUE,1,0)
